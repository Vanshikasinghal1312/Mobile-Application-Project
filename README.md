## Setting up the React-native development environment
**Run the following command to create a new React Native project called "register"**
- npx create-expo-app "register"
- cd register
- npx expo start
> This will start a development server for you.
## Running your React Native application
Install the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. On Android, use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project. On iOS, use the built-in QR code scanner of the default iOS Camera app.
## Modifying your app
Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it. Open App.js in your text editor of choice and edit some lines. The application should reload automatically once you save your changes.

## That's it!
Congratulations! You've successfully run and modified your first React Native app.
## Running your app on a simulator or virtual device
Expo Go allows you to run your React Native app on a physical device without installing iOS and Android native SDKs. If you want to run your app on the iOS Simulator or an Android Virtual Device, please refer to the instructions for "React Native CLI Quickstart" to learn how to install Xcode or set up your Android development environment.
Once you've set these up, you can launch your app on an Android Virtual Device by running 'npm run' android, or on the iOS Simulator by running 'npm run ios' (macOS only).
